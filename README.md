## Replication Material ## 

The `analysis` R Markdown file contains the code to replicate all results and visualisations used in the following capstone project: "Scandalous Effects: The Impact of Political Candidates on Party Identification". 

The data sources used in this analysis are: 
1. ESS Wave 8: publicly accessible at https://ess.sikt.no/en/?tab=overview
2. Sciences Po DYNAMOB Wave 1-18: accessible upon request with an institutional log in at: https://data.sciencespo.fr/dataverse/dynamob. 

For the `load data` chunk to run successfully, the data should be downloaded as CSV files and all DYNAMOB CSV files should be contained in the same folder. The working directory should also be adapted.
